Description: The MRAPSS package implement the MR-APPSS approach to test for the causal effects between an exposure and a outcome disease.
        The MR-APPSS is a unified approach to Mendelian Randomization accounting for polygenicity, pleiotropy and sample structure using genome-wide summary statistics.
        Specifically, MR-APPSS uses a background-foreground model to characterize both SNP-exposure effects and SNP-outcome effects estimates, where the background model accounts for confounding from genetic correlation and sample structure and the foreground model captures the valid signal for causal inference.
